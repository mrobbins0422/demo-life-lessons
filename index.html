                    <p>They enjoyed it so much that one year, I took them with me on the opening day of trout season up in the blue ridge mountains.<br>Opening day of trout season can be a pretty exciting event since you know they have recently stocked the stream and you literally have people lining the banks of the stream, as far as the eye can see, in either direction.<br>Between baiting hooks, unhooking fish, freeing up snags, and crossed lines. I didn't get a lick of fishing in. Still, it was always fun each time my daughter or son caught a fish.<br>act is, it seemed like every time they didn't get snagged or didn't snag someone else's line, they caught a fish!<br>At one point I was telling my son to be more careful as he had crossed the line of the man fishing next to us.<br>After he promised to be more careful the white haired gentleman fishing next to him looked down and said, 'Don't fret too much son, there's plenty of creek for all of us.'</p>
